# 📊 Business Case – Target SQL (Brazil E-Commerce Analysis)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **100,000+ e-commerce orders** from Target’s operations in Brazil (2016–2018). Using SQL, I explored order status, pricing, freight performance, customer demographics, product attributes, and customer reviews to generate **business insights**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze **order status distribution** and fulfillment efficiency.  
- Examine **pricing and freight performance** across regions.  
- Study **customer demographics and location-based patterns**.  
- Explore **product attributes and categories**.  
- Assess **customer review scores** and their relation to delivery/service quality.  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used  
- **SQL** (joins, aggregations, filtering, grouping, time-based analysis)  
- **Data Analysis** – order processing, shipping performance, customer segmentation  
- **Excel / Google Sheets** – supporting calculations and summaries  

---

## 🔍 Approach  
1. **Data Exploration**: Imported and examined datasets (customers, orders, sellers, products, reviews, geolocation, order items).  
2. **Order Status Analysis**: Measured proportions of delivered, shipped, canceled, and pending orders.  
3. **Freight & Pricing**: Evaluated freight charges relative to product cost and delivery performance.  
4. **Customer Demographics**: Mapped distribution of customers by city and state.  
5. **Product Analysis**: Reviewed product categories, weights, and volume distribution.  
6. **Customer Reviews**: Studied satisfaction trends using review scores.

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **Delivered orders** accounted for the majority, but there were notable delays and cancellations.  
- Freight cost was **highly variable** and sometimes disproportionate to product price.  
- **São Paulo (SP)** emerged as the leading state in terms of customer base and orders.  
- Many products had **imbalanced attribute distributions** (weights/volumes not standardized).  
- Review scores showed a direct link to **delivery delays and order issues**.  

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations  
- Improve **order tracking and fulfillment systems** to reduce delays/cancellations.  
- Standardize **freight calculations** and optimize shipping logistics.  
- Focus marketing and sales in **high-demand states** like São Paulo.  
- Enhance **product data quality** for better inventory and catalog management.  
- Use **customer reviews** proactively to identify and resolve operational issues.
